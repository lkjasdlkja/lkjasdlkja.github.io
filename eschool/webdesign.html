    </header>

        <h2>New Plaza to Bring Culver’s and More</h2>
        <p>Kenosha residents will soon see a new shopping plaza taking shape just north of Pick ’n’ Save on 18th Street. One of the highlights of this development will be a <strong>Culver’s restaurant</strong>, along with three additional stores that have yet to be announced. Construction is expected to begin later this year, and local businesses are already preparing for the increased foot traffic the plaza will bring.</p>
        <p>"This area has been waiting for a boost like this," said City Development Director Tim Casey. <q>The new plaza will provide both jobs and convenience to our community.</q></p>

        <h2>Starbucks Plans to Open in North Shore Bank Building</h2>
        <p>Starbucks fans have something to look forward to, as the popular coffee chain is expected to move into the North Shore Bank branch building on Green Bay Road, which will soon be vacated. While the transition is still in its early stages, the potential addition of a Starbucks reflects the growing demand for amenities in the area.</p>


    

        <h2>Downtown Redevelopment Underway</h2>
        <p>In downtown Kenosha, a former Chase drive-thru has been demolished to make way for a five-story apartment building. This project marks the first phase of a massive nine-block downtown redevelopment plan. The new building will bring additional housing options to the area, supporting the city’s vision for a revitalized and vibrant downtown.</p>
        <blockquote>“This redevelopment is a game-changer for Kenosha,” said Casey. “It’s about creating a downtown that’s modern, functional, and reflective of our city’s future.”</blockquote>
